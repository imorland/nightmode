                    auto: We'll choose which theme to use based on your browser or device settings. For example, if you have Dark Mode enabled in iOS or Android, we'll enable it on the forums too. Lovely jubbly!
                    light: The classic experience which you're used to. Loved and tested.
                    dark: You're a bit of a night owl. You watch over the forum at night, while the birds are sleeping and the foxes are hunting. Or you just prefer the darker colours!
                    oled: You're a battery saver! You opt for the theme which helps you save power on your mobile device. You might also just love the absolute black colour all around the forum instead of the dark grey in dark mode.
